# BoostConverter
Design of DC-DC Boost Converter


The necessary circuit parameters are calculated before designing. 
The control circuit is made using an Arduino UNO. 
The control circuit is used to generate pulses of certain frequency according to the parameters of the boost converter. 
The power circuit is designed in simulink. 
The components are then imlemented on a GPB and the required voltage output is observed on the DSO.
